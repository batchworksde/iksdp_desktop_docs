## Remote Support Using JetKVM  

There might be situations where the support team needs to connect directly to a local computer.  
For this reason, a JetKVM device has been set up.  

![jetkvm1](../shared/images/jetkvm1.png)  

The device must be connected via USB to the computer, and an HDMI cable must be connected from the JetKVM to the PC. Because of this setup, no output will be visible on the screen while the device is connected. Additionally, the JetKVM must be connected to a switch port in the lab, specifically on ports 2â€“8. Other devices, such as the printer, must be temporarily disconnected.  

The support team will connect to the JetKVM device via VPN or cloud access.  

On the local network, the device is accessible at [http://192.168.200.20](http://192.168.200.20).
