2. Now click the **"Rustdesk"-Icon**.  
![Rustdesk00](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk00.png)
3. A different way to start Rustdesk would be by opening the Applications Tab in the taskbar at the top and then click on **"Internet"** and **"Rustdesk"**.  
![Rustdesk01](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk01.png)
4. Now you will send the **"ID"** and the **"One-time Password"** which you can see on the left side to the person you want to receive Support from.  
![Rustdesk02](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk02.png)
5. A small window might appear which shows that a device wants to connect to your Computer. Normally the connection gets automatically established. If not, click the **"Accept"** Button.  
![Rustdesk03](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk03.png)
6. If its the first time someone connects to your Computer then you will have to select the screen which should be shared. Select the screen, tick the box **"Remember this selection"** and then click **"Share"**.  
![Rustdesk04](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk04.png)

![Rustdesk05](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk05.png)

### Stop the Remote Session
1. Move your mouse over the **"Rustdesk"-Icon** in the left sidebar. Now two smaller windows should appear next to the sidebar.  
2. Click on the window which shows the active connection.  
![Rustdesk07](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk07.png)

4. Click **"Disconnect"** to end the remote session.  
![Rustdesk08](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk08.png)
5. The small icon in the top taskbar ![Rustdesk09](../shared/images/poweruser/rustdesk/rustdesk09.png) should now be disappeared, which means the connection is closed for the remote device.

## Remote Support Using JetKVM  

There might be situations where the support team needs to connect directly to a local computer.  
For this reason, a JetKVM device has been set up.  

![jetkvm1](../shared/images/jetkvm1.png)  

The device must be connected via USB to the computer, and an HDMI cable must be connected from the JetKVM to the PC. Because of this setup, no output will be visible on the screen while the device is connected. Additionally, the JetKVM must be connected to a switch port in the lab, specifically on ports 2â€“8. Other devices, such as the printer, must be temporarily disconnected.  

The support team will connect to the JetKVM device via VPN or cloud access.  

On the local network, the device is accessible at [http://192.168.200.20](http://192.168.200.20).
